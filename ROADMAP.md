# ROADMAP

It's important here, as with any project, to have a clear idea of the small steps to take in order to achieve the larger one. So, with that in mind, let's dive in.

## Large/End Goal
Allow for a single player to be able to race a NPC (recording) with a car.

## Smaller Goals
0. Use `samp-debug.exe` to go in-game and record the NPC's movements, save the race checkpoint locations, the car locations, and the spawn locations.
1. Spawn the player, npc, and cars in those positions.
2. Command to have the NPC "play" the recording (i.e. drive), stop, and then reset car and his position to original.
3. Partial checkpoint system for player (only test 2 here).
4. Finish checkpoint system for player.
5. Incorporate win/lose logic into the race.
6. Clean up/improvements.

These will all have different tags within the `main` branch that students will download and have as their working directory. There may or may not be some more commits in the middle, but [cahoa itself](https://github.com/lagoevia/cahoa) will explain the steps necessary in detail.
